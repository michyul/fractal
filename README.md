# Fractal Generator

This project contains a simple web-based fractal image generator implemented in HTML and JavaScript. It can render Mandelbrot and Julia sets on a canvas element.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. The fractal image is drawn automatically when the page loads. Select the fractal type, adjust the iteration count and (for Julia set) a complex constant. Clicking **Render** redraws the fractal with the current settings.

The rendering runs entirely in the browser.
