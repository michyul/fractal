# Fractal Generator

This project contains a simple web-based fractal image generator implemented in HTML and JavaScript. It can render Mandelbrot and Julia sets on a canvas element.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser. Select the fractal type, choose **Fractal** or **Random Colors** mode, adjust the iteration count and (for Julia set) a complex constant, then click **Render** to generate the output.

When **Random Colors** mode is selected a new pattern will be drawn each time the page is refreshed.

The rendering runs entirely in the browser.
